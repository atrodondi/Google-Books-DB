# Google-Books-DB

Finding cool books using the Google Book API and saving the ones you like to a MongoDB.

# Objective

Using the MERN stack to allow users to search an API for books, store books in a database that they like and come back later to see the saved books. Users can also view the Google Books website of each book as well if they want, whether the book is saved or not. Users can also delete books from the database and off the save list as well!

# Live App

Go to the [Deployed App](https://googlebookssearchmern.herokuapp.com/) and you can search for books using the search bar, view and save!

# How-To-Install-Locally / Add-To-Project

1.  Clone the repo to your local machine.
2.  Make sure all dependencies and tools are installed by making sure to `npm install` in the main server directory and in the React App main directory "/client", or wherever your two package.json files are.
3.  Make sure to edit any developer specific information in the server file and/or create your own .env file to put api keys and your own MONGODB_URI
4.  Once all the dependencies are installed, just start up the server.js file with `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js` and the react app in the react app folder with `npm start`.
5.  Fool around on the app locally and/or add some stuff!
